My name is Luís Pedro Pires Borges and I'm from Lisbon, Portugal. I completed my Bachelor's and my Master's degree at the Instituto Superior Técnico. My M.Sc. work concerned the application of Deep Learning techniques to a fake news detection problem, more precisely, the task specified by the [Fake News Challenge](http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/).

My research is focused on Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Deep Learning. Currently, I am pursuing a Dual-Degree Ph.D. in Language Technologies, offered by the Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon, and the Carnegie Mellon University. I am working under the supervision of Professors [Bruno Martins](http://web.ist.utl.pt/bruno.g.martins/) and [Jamie Callan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~callan/). For more information regarding my professional life, please consult the CV section on this webpage.
